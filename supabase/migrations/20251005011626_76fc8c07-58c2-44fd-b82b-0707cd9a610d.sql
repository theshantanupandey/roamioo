-- Fix trips table - Remove invalid columns from CreatePost.tsx references
-- The trips table doesn't need path_type or path_metadata since we already have path_id

-- Verify the trips table structure is correct
-- path_id already exists and is the only column needed for path linking

-- Fix path_waypoints table to ensure it doesn't require images
-- Waypoints should not have an image_url column since PathStop interface doesn't include stored images
-- The 'image' field in PathStop is just a preview URL, not a stored URL

-- No changes needed to database structure - the issue is in the application code
-- The CreatePost.tsx is trying to insert non-existent columns

-- Let's verify RLS policies are correct for group_chats
